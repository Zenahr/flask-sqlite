# Flask-Sqlite local app

## Purpose
I want to explore some possibly useful scenarios for local apps built using web technologies using flask and utilizing sqlite as a data storage.

I will want to implement a simple CRUD-App, Add in search and filter functionality, maybe bind the app to a custom rest-api on the web and start sending data there (Maybe a file uploader would be a sweet feature-set)

Only time will tell what I will make.
